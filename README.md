Altis Insurgency
===============

This is an Insurgency type mission for ARMA 3. This is bound to Altis, but you can get around this limitation by creating a Game Logic on the island called "Server." Create zones, and replace the zone names in spawnEnemies.sqf to add combat zones on top of urban areas.

I try to rewrite code to my liking/what I think is required for the mission. Code is borrowed, and created, and I don't mind if you use code found here as is or modified.
