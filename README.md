Altis Insurgency
===============

This is an Insurgency type mission for ARMA 3. As far as I'm aware, it can be played on any map that follows Bohemia standards of map design. That is, a map with a properly formatted and populated cfg file will run this mission just fine.

Code from this mission is mostly custom. That being said, I have also borrowed a ton of ideas and methods from various sources. I will try to list them all below: 

* VAS - no longer used
* EOS - no longer used - used as template for custom caching system 
* INS_Revive - mostly original code, slightly modified
* Igiloader - inspiration, mostly
* IgiLifter? - I think that's what it was originally called. In any case, I've modified the original source enough that I can call it my own. 
* reddit.com/r/armadev - for code support
* LV - for the ambient combat idea and general logic. 

Features: 
* Close Air Support
* Unit caching (loading units is still CPU intensive, though)
* Revive system
* Group management system
* and much more...

Feel free to use whatever code you find here, I like sharing. Just be sure to give a shoutout somewhere on your git or in your mission somewhere (doesn't even have to be publicly).
